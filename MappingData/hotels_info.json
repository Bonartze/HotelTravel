It features 7 dining options, a concierge and free Wi-Fi at the entire property. marshaKaJapanWe stayed three nights at this hotel; the staff were all helpful and efficient.  We enjoyed the 'grand', traditional style of the hotel.  It is conveniently located in downtown so we could walk to the nearby restaurants and Odori park.  We rented a car for the day to drive to the outlying areas to see the Lavendar garden at Hitsugigaoka, and ride the ski lift at the Olympic Park. The beer, of course, in Sapporo is the best!.",

It didn't have frills (like TV, kettle etc) but that didn't bother me as I was out most of the day. Guests can use a common kitchen on the first floor. It is equipped with a kettle and microwave/oven and a vending machine. There is a laundry room (paid). I didn't use it but I would have if I was staying longer. Good security – guests need an access card to enter the lobby (after check in) and use the lifts. Loved the luggage storage facility as that allowed me to check out on time but sight-see without dragging my bag around till I needed to catch my flight. I think the hotel is great value for money... Would use it again... Loved the fact that check in and check out was automated and efficient...",

The Clarion Hotel Oslo was in my estimation about as perfect as I could imagine. The location is exceptional, near everything but not right in the middle of anything so it was supremely quiet. A short walk to the train station making it super convenient for in/outbound travel. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were super helpful and welcoming. The breakfast was huge, with something for everyone and was one of the best I've ever had! I was in for breakfast early so never had any problems, and observed that it got very busy later, so time it right and you'll enjoy an amazing meal.
