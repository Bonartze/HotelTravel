DONNAUnited States of AmericaThe Electra Palace hotel is located in The Plaka District.  It was very easy to walk to the acropolis and museum,  great restaurants and shopping but also an easy walk to Monastiraki.  The Roof Top Restaurant was very good and offers a spectacular  view of the Acropolis.  The infinity pool was very nice and considering the heat, the water was refreshingly cool.  There is an outside bar area by the pool where you could order great drinks and food. The only downside to the pool areas was there were not enough seats with shade and the heat was intense.  Our room was clean and comfortable and we had a balcony with a view of the acropolis.  If going back to Athens, I would not hesitate to stay heare.",
