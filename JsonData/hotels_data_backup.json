I stayed at a \"King Bed, High Floor\" room for 4 nights. The king-sized bed was soooo comfortable. I have sleep problems, but I was able to get a good night's rest every night thanks to the comfy mattress and pillows. Maybe it was too comfortable, because I didn't want to get out of bed at times 😝 The room was always clean (thank you, Housekeeping team) and the A/C worked like wonders (cool and cozy was the atmosphere). Not a single dust was seen on the washroom area, and the toilet and shower worked well, too. The rooms also had all the basic amenities.\n\nSecond, location. I was told by my tour driver that the location of the hotel is good, because it's right on the \"entrance\" of Delhi (under the assumption that you are coming back from Agra or Jaipur). It's also safe to stay at because all passerby goes through security check upon entering the building. Not only is the hotel close to the airport, but also has free airport pick-up/drop-off service.\n\nThird, room service & food. I had breakfast included in my reservation which, upon request, was brought to my room. This saved me a lot of time as I was able to eat while getting ready to leave for a tour. Room service was also exceptional. They're quick to answer your calls and cater to your needs any time of the day. The meals were not too salty or strongly flavored. I especially loved the fruit platter for its freshness and variety.\n\nLast but not least, staff. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I initially had an issue with the room, in which I was not given a \"6 and above floor\" room that I originally booked for. I didn't notice it myself until my second-to-last night, when I went over to the reception desk to request late checkout. The staff and manager were quick to fix the problem by reimbursing me with a discounted late checkout fee. Also, each and every staff are extremely responsive.",

        "preview_comment": "First, the rooms. I stayed at a \"King Bed, High Floor\" room for 4 nights. The king-sized bed was soooo comfortable. I have sleep problems, but I was able to get a good night's rest every night thanks to the comfy mattress and pillows. Maybe it was too comfortable, because I didn't want to get out of bed at times 😝 The room was always clean (thank you, Housekeeping team) and the A/C worked like wonders (cool and cozy was the atmosphere). Not a single dust was seen on the washroom area, and the toilet and shower worked well, too. The rooms also had all the basic amenities.\n\nSecond, location. I was told by my tour driver that the location of the hotel is good, because it's right on the \"entrance\" of Delhi (under the assumption that you are coming back from Agra or Jaipur). It's also safe to stay at because all passerby goes through security check upon entering the building. Not only is the hotel close to the airport, but also has free airport pick-up/drop-off service.\n\nThird, room service & food. I had breakfast included in my reservation which, upon request, was brought to my room. This saved me a lot of time as I was able to eat while getting ready to leave for a tour. Room service was also exceptional. They're quick to answer your calls and cater to your needs any time of the day. The meals were not too salty or strongly flavored. I especially loved the fruit platter for its freshness and variety.\n\nLast but not least, staff. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I initially had an issue with the room, in which I was not given a \"6 and above floor\" room that I originally booked for. I didn't notice it myself until my second-to-last night, when I went over to the reception desk to request late checkout. The staff and manager were quick to fix the problem by reimbursing me with a discounted late checkout fee. Also, each and every staff are extremely responsive."

The staff members were very helpful and they even helped us to take our luggage back to the ferry terminal. There is a bus route (Sosun route) which has a stop close to the hotel.  The hotel has an awesome breakfast buffet and the food was very tasty. The hotel looked after our excess luggage while we visited a different resort island and after we checked out of the hotel (We had a late flight and we did some shopping after checking out). The staff was kind enough to let us use a bathroom to freshen ourselves and change clothes before we left for the airport. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience at Zan Lodge."
